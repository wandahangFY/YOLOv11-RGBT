## Introduction
This project aims to demonstrate how to configure visible and infrared datasets to accommodate multimodal object detection tasks based on YOLOv11. With three different configuration methods (directory configuration and TXT file configuration), you can easily associate visible light datasets with infrared datasets.

- YAML files for all YOLO series from YOLOv3 to YOLOv12, along with corresponding RGBT YAML files, have been added.
- The training mode of YOLOv11 itself is retained. It is recommended to learn how to set up the YOLOv11 environment and how to use it before using this project (YOLOv11 environment can be used seamlessly).

- Added YAML files for all YOLO series from YOLOv3 to YOLOv12, as well as the corresponding RGBT YAML files.
- Retained the original training mode of YOLOv11. It is recommended to first learn how to set up the environment and usage of YOLOv11 before using this project (which can seamlessly utilize the environment of YOLOv11).
- Supports multi-spectral object detection, multi-spectral keypoint detection, and multi-spectral instance segmentation tasks.
- Compared to YOLOv11, two additional parameters have been added: channels, use_simotm, and the ch in the YAML model file must correspond accordingly.
- channels: 1 # (int) Number of model channels, detailed introduction is provided below.
- use_simotm: SimOTMBBS # (str) The training mode used, such as BGR, RGBT, Gray, etc.

## Supported image formats（use_simotm）:
1. uint8: 'Gray'  Single-channel 8-bit gray-scale image.  channels=1 ,  yaml   ch: 1 
2. uint16: 'Gray16bit' Single-channel 16-bit gray-scale image.  channels=1 ,  yaml   ch: 1 
3. uint8: 'SimOTM' 'SimOTMBBS'   Single-channel 8-bit gray-scale image TO Three-channel 8-bit gray-scale image.  channels=3 ,  yaml   ch: 3 
4. uint8: 'BGR'  Three-channel 8-bit color image.  channels=3 ,  yaml   ch: 3 
5. unit8: 'RGBT' Four-channel 8-bit color image.(Including early fusion, middle fusion, late fusion, score fusion, weight sharing mode)  channels=4 ,  yaml   ch: 4 
6. unit8: 'RGBRGB6C' Six-channel 8-bit color image.(Including early fusion, middle fusion, late fusion, score fusion, weight sharing mode) channels=6 ,  yaml   ch: 6 
7. unit8: 'Multispectral'  8-bit multi-spectral images for any channel (including pre-fusion, mid-fusion, post-fusion, fractional fusion, and weight-sharing mode) channels=n

Among them, the directory format of 1-4 is consistent with YOLOv8. With train.txt and val.txt, all you need to do is write the image address below visible, and the data format directory of 'RGBT' is as follows:


## Dataset Configuration

### 1. Dataset Structure
In YOLOv8, the visible light (visible) directory must conform to the dataset configuration principles. Additionally, an infrared (infrared) directory must exist at the same level as the visible light directory. Furthermore, the dataset should be divided into `train` and `val` (optional) subdirectories for training and validation purposes, respectively.

### 2. Configuration Methods
Below are four recommended configuration methods (Method 1 is preferred and matches the *NewVersion* dataset in the shared drive; the other three are legacy layouts for older releases):

#### Important Notes
- Ensure that the visible and infrared directories are at the same level.
- If constructing a YAML file using TXT files, the TXT file paths must include `visible` so that the program can automatically replace it with `infrared`.
- If you encounter issues, please refer to the `load_image` function in `ultralytics/data/base.py`.

---


#### Method 1: Directory Layout (FLIR example, matching the “new-version” folder in the shared drive)
Store RGB and thermal data in two peer-level folders. Each modality contains train and test sub-folders. The structure is:
```
dataset/                  # root of the real dataset; keep any name, any location
│   ├── visible/          # RGB images + labels
│   │   ├── train/        # training split
│   │   │    ├── image1.jpg 
│   │   │    ├── image1.txt   
│   │   │    ├── image2.jpg   
│   │   │    ├── image2.txt 
│   │   │    └── ...
│   │   └── test/         # val / test split
│   │        ├── image5.jpg 
│   │        ├── image5.txt   
│   │        ├── image6.jpg   
│   │        ├── image6.txt 
│   │        └── ...
│   └── infrared/         # thermal images + labels
│       ├── train/        # training split
│       │    ├── image1.jpg 
│   │   │    ├── image1.txt   
│   │   │    ├── image2.jpg   
│   │   │    ├── image2.txt 
│   │   │    └── ...
│       └── test/         # val / test split
│            ├── image5.jpg 
│            ├── image5.txt   
│            ├── image6.jpg   
│            ├── image6.txt 
│            └── ...
labels/                   # optional; can be omitted
    ├── train/
    │   ├── image1.txt
    │   └── image2.txt
    └── test/
        ├── image5.txt
        └── image6.txt

```
```
# FLIR_aligned-rgbt.yaml  RGB + thermal dataset descriptor

path: E:/BaiduNetdiskDownload/RGBTO/FLIR3C  # change to your path
train: visible/train
val:   visible/test

## absolute paths also work
# train: E:/BaiduNetdiskDownload/RGBTO/FLIR3C/visible/train
# val:   E:/BaiduNetdiskDownload/RGBTO/FLIR3C/visible/test

# number of classes
nc: 3

# class names
names: ["person", "car", "bicycle"]
```

```
# FLIR_aligned-rgb.yaml  RGB-only descriptor (same content, for clarity)

path: E:/BaiduNetdiskDownload/RGBTO/FLIR3C
train: visible/train
val:   visible/test
nc: 3
names: ["person", "car", "bicycle"]
```

```
# FLIR_aligned-inf.yaml  thermal-only descriptor

path: E:/BaiduNetdiskDownload/RGBTO/FLIR3C
train: infrared/train
val:   infrared/test
nc: 3
names: ["person", "car", "bicycle"]
```

#### Method 2: Directory Configuration (KAIST Configuration Example)
Store visible and infrared data in directories at the same level, with each modality divided into `train` and `val` subdirectories. The directory structure is as follows:

```
dataset/  # Root directory of the dataset
├── train/  # Store training data
│   ├── visible/  # Data related to visible light images
│   │   ├── images/  # Visible light image files
│   │   └── labels/  # Label files for visible light images (e.g., annotation information)
│   └── infrared/  # Data related to infrared images
│       ├── images/  # Infrared image files
│       └── labels/  # Label files for infrared images (e.g., annotation information)
└── val/  # Store validation data
    ├── visible/  # Data related to visible light images
    │   ├── images/  # Visible light image files
    │   └── labels/  # Label files for visible light images (e.g., annotation information)
    └── infrared/  # Data related to infrared images
        ├── images/  # Infrared image files
        └── labels/  # Label files for infrared images (e.g., annotation information)

---------------------------------------------------------------------

# KAIST.yaml

# train and val data as 1) directory: path/images/
train: dataset/train/visible/images  # 7601 images
val:  dataset/val/visible/images # 2257 images

# number of classes
nc: 1

# class names
names: [ 'person', ]

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

- **train/visible**: Stores visible light images and their labels for the training set.
- **train/infrared**: Stores infrared images and their labels for the training set.
- **val/visible**: Stores visible light images and their labels for the validation set.
- **val/infrared**: Stores infrared images and their labels for the validation set.

The program will automatically recognize visible and infrared data through the directory structure.

#### Method 3: Directory Configuration (Configuration Example)
Under the second-level directory, store visible and infrared data in directories at the same level, with each modality divided into `train` and `val` subdirectories. The directory structure is as follows:

```
dataset/
├── images/
│   ├── visible/
│   │   ├── train/  # Store training visible light images
│   │   └── val/    # Store validation visible light images
│   └── infrared/
│       ├── train/  # Store training infrared images
│       └── val/    # Store validation infrared images
└── labels/
    ├── visible/
    │   ├── train/  # Store training visible light image labels
    │   └── val/    # Store validation visible light image labels
    └── infrared/
        ├── train/  # Store training infrared image labels
        └── val/    # Store validation infrared image labels

---------------------------------------------------------------------

# KAIST.yaml

# train and val data as 1) directory: path/images/
train: dataset/images/visible/train  # 7601 images
val:   dataset/images/visible/val # 2257 images

# number of classes
nc: 1

# class names
names: [ 'person', ]

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

- **`images/`**: Stores all image data.
  - **`visible/`**: Contains visible light images.
    - **`train/`**: Visible light images for model training.
    - **`val/`**: Visible light images for model validation.
  - **`infrared/`**: Contains infrared images.
    - **`train/`**: Infrared images for model training.
    - **`val/`**: Infrared images for model validation.

- **`labels/`**: Stores all image label information (e.g., annotation files, comments).
  - **`visible/`**: Contains labels for visible light images.
    - **`train/`**: Labels for the training set of visible light images.
    - **`val/`**: Labels for the validation set of visible light images.
  - **`infrared/`**: Contains labels for infrared images.
    - **`train/`**: Labels for the training set of infrared images.
    - **`val/`**: Labels for the validation set of infrared images.

The program will automatically recognize visible and infrared data through the directory structure.

#### Method 4: TXT File Configuration (VEDAI Configuration Example)
Use TXT files to specify data paths. The TXT file content should include visible light image paths, and the program will automatically replace them with the corresponding infrared paths. TXT files need to specify the paths for the training and validation sets (default configuration method for YOLOv5, YOLOv8, YOLOv11).

```
dataset/
├── images/
│   ├── visible/    # Store  visible light images
│   │   ├── image1.jpg  
│   │   └── image2.jpg
│   │   └── ...      
│   └── infrared/  #  Store  visible light images
│       ├── image1.jpg   
│       └── image2.jpg  
│       └── ...         
└── labels/
    ├── visible/  # Store  visible light labels
    │   ├── image1.txt   
    │   └── image2.txt 
    └── infrared/  # Store  infrared light labels
        ├── image1.txt
        └── image2.txt    
        
---------------------------------------------------------------------

# VEDAI.yaml

train:  G:/wan/data/RGBT/VEDAI/VEDAI_train.txt  # 16551 images
val:  G:/wan/data/RGBT/VEDAI/VEDAI_trainval.txt # 4952 images

# number of classes
nc: 9

# class names
names: ['plane', 'boat', 'camping_car', 'car', 'pick-up', 'tractor', 'truck', 'van', 'others']

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
        
```

**Example TXT File Content:**

**train.txt**
```
dataset/images/visible/image1.jpg
dataset/images/visible/image2.jpg
dataset/images/visible/image3.jpg
```

**val.txt**
```
dataset/images/visible/image4.jpg
dataset/images/visible/image5.jpg
dataset/images/visible/image6.jpg
```

The program will replace `visible` with `infrared` in the paths to find the corresponding infrared images.

### 3. Principle Explanation
In the `load_image` function in `ultralytics/data/base.py`, there is a line of code that replaces `visible` with `infrared` in the visible light path. Therefore, as long as there is an infrared directory at the same level as the visible light directory, the program can correctly load the corresponding infrared data.

## Important Notes (Emphasized Again)
- Ensure that the visible and infrared directories are at the same level, and there are `train` and `val` subdirectories under each modality.
- TXT file paths must include `visible` so that the program can automatically replace it with `infrared`.
- If you encounter issues, please refer to the `load_image` function in `ultralytics/data/base.py`.
